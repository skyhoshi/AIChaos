# Campaign Gamemode for Garry's Mod

A minimal Half-Life 2 campaign gamemode - essentially just vanilla Half-Life 2 in Garry's Mod.

## What is this?

This is a bare-bones gamemode that provides the basic Half-Life 2 experience without any modifications. No custom HUD, no teams, no special features - just pure HL2 gameplay.

## Installation

This gamemode is included in the AIChaos addon. To use it:

1. Make sure the addon is in your `garrysmod/addons/` folder
2. Start Garry's Mod
3. Go to the main menu
4. Click "New Game"
5. Select "Campaign" from the gamemode list
6. Choose a Half-Life 2 map (like `d1_trainstation_01`)
7. Click "Start Game"

## Recommended Maps

The gamemode works with any Half-Life 2 maps:
- `d1_trainstation_01` through `d1_trainstation_06`
- `d1_canals_01` through `d1_canals_13`
- `d1_town_01` through `d1_town_05`
- `d2_coast_01` through `d2_coast_12`
- `d2_prison_01` through `d2_prison_08`
- `d3_citadel_01` through `d3_citadel_05`

## That's it!

This gamemode intentionally does nothing special. It's just a wrapper to play Half-Life 2 maps in Garry's Mod.
